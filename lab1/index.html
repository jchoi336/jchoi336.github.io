    <h1>My WebArt Project Statement</h1>

    <p>by James Choi</p>

	<p>This project was inspired by the many net art sites that popped up through the 90s and early 2000s. The site is intended to be viewed in a 1280x800 or smaller resolution.</p>

	<p>This is what I consider to be a multi media project. It is a combination of</p>
    <ul>
        <li>text created through HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>digital photos taken on my cell phone</li>
        <li>scans of prints from old school film cameras</li>
        <li>images drawn from scratch using Adobe Photoshop and a graphics tablet with a stylus</li>
    </ul>
    
	<p>This work seeks to emulate a migration through differing physical spaces and their relationship to humankind. Starting with the vast emptiness and relative simplicity of outer space, we probe through the nothingness to finally stumble upon Earth. Here, we look into some spaces in which humanity inhabits.</p>
