    <h1>My WebArt Project Statement</h1>
    <p>by James Choi</p>
	<p>This is what I consider to be a multi media project. It is a combination of</p>
    <ul>
        <li>text created through HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>digital photos taken on my cell phone</li>
        <li>scans of prints from old school film cameras</li>
        <li>images drawn from scratch using Adobe Photoshop and a graphics tablet with a stylus</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>This project was inspired by the many net art sites that popped up through the 90s and early 2000s. 
        It seeks to emulate a migration through differing physical spaces and their relationship to humankind.</p> 
    <p>The site is intended to be viewed in a 1280x800 or other smaller oldschool resolution.</p>
