    <h1>My WebArt Project Statement</h1>

    <p>by James Choi</p>

	<p>This project was inspired by the many net art sites that popped up through the 90s and early 2000s. The site is intended to be viewed in a 1280x800 or smaller resolution.</p>

	<p>This is what I consider to be a multi media project. It is a combination of</p>
    <ul>
        <li>text created through HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>digital photos taken on my cell phone</li>
        <li>scans of prints from old school film cameras</li>
        <li>images drawn from scratch using Adobe Photoshop and a graphics tablet with a stylus</li>
    </ul>
    
	<p>This work seeks to emulate a migration through differing physical spaces and their relationship to humankind. Starting with the vast emptiness and relative simplicity of outer space, we probe through the nothingness to finally stumble upon Earth. Here, we look into some spaces in which humanity inhabits.</p>

	<p>From here we encounter a fairly idyllic and rural landscape with vibrant colours, vegetation and humble abodes. A seemingly fantastical place that is progressively becoming but a fond memory.</p>
	<p>The scenery then changes to one that is much more hectic. We see visions of places real and imagined that are increasingly urban, sprawling, and chaotic. This mirrors the struggle that societies and cultures face in order to keep pace with the modern era of exponential growth in terms of population and technology.</p>
	<p>We then set our eyes towards the sky once more. Perhaps, the stars are our next frontier, or perhaps we will both prosper and perish on our special floating rock. For all that we have done in our time here, it is as if nothing happened at all. We seem rather insignificant compared to the vast expanse that is the cosmos, largely untouched by humanity.</p>
